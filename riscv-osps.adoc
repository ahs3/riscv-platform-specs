## Introduction

This document is the RISC-V Operating System Platform Specification
(OSPS).  This specification defines the hardware and firmware
required to be able to install and use one or more operating systems on a
platform built around the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
The intent is to set out the constraints necessary
for a hardware platform so that an operating system can be assured
it is compatible with that platform, if the platform is in compliance
with this specification.

This specification also sets out the constraints on the
RISCV-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) -- at all privilege 
levels -- that are needed to provide a consistent and predictable
environment for running these operating systems.

The OSPS sets out the constraints on platforms as _use cases_.  Each
use case specifies a particular combination of hardware platform
and operating system to be used in specific environments.  For example,
the general purpose computing use case specifies the expected hardware
and firmware for systems such as commercial laptop, desktop or server
computers; these use cases generally match acknowledged market
segments possible for RISC-V based platforms.

In order for a platform to be compliant with OSPS, it must be compliant
with a specific use case.  That may allow it to be compliant with other
use cases, but it is recommended that a platform have one specific target
to start from.  For any given use case, all mandatory requirements must be
implemented in the platform.  Optional requirements may or may not be
implemented on any given platform; if such a requirement
could cause the platform to behave differently when not implemented,
a fallback position is specified that must be implemented.

Over time, it is expected that each use case will see a series of
revisions.  Under ideal circumstances, a platform will be compliant
with the most recent version of any use case specification.  When a
platform indicates it is compliant with the OSPS, it should specify
a use case *and* a specific revision of that use case.

## Use Cases
We define these use cases:

* General purpose computing, where the hardware and software of a system
are expected to change over time, and configurations of hardware and software
can be highly variable.
* Appliance computing, where the hardware configuration is essentially
fixed, but software is expected to change.
* Special purpose computing, where hardware and software typically do not
change once shipped from the factory.

### Common Requirements
This section is currently a placeholder.

NOTE: As requirements for individual use cases are uncovered, it is
expected that some will end up being common to all cases.  If so, they
should be moved to this section.

### General Purpose Computing
This use case sets out the requirements for what is commonly known
as _general purpose computing_.  For platforms of this type, it is expected
that the user will be able to add or remove cards such as PCIe or SATA, 
add or remove devices such as disks, monitors or graphics cards, and will
be able to choose from one or more available operating systems.  Commercial
desktop, laptop or server systems are primary examples.

Operating systems for this use case include at a minimum the members
of the Linux families (Fedora, Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, and similar).  If
a platform is compliant with the requirements of this use case, it should
be possible to easily install and maintain any of the Linux distributions
without modification.

It should also be possible to use any of the other Unix-based operating
systems and distributions such as those in the BSD family, as well as
commercial operating systems such as Microsoft Windows.

The stress here is on the idea of _general_ computing, and hence most of
the readily available operating systems designed for that environment.  The
goal is to be able to seamlessly replace existing systems based on other
ISAs.

### Appliance Computing
This use case sets out the requirements for _appliance computing_.
For platforms of this type, it is expected that the user will *NOT*
be able to add or remove cards or devices, with the possible exception
of adding memory devices such as SD cards.  The hardware in such a
system is essentially fixed for the life of the device.  Primary
examples are devices such as tablets, smart phones, automobile systems,
or even some refrigerators.

The operating system and applications on such appliances may change
over time.  However, the owner of the device will not be able to
arbitrarily change the operating system or firmware installed (unless
they are _really_ clever); in general, this would be fairly strictly
controlled by the device manufacturer.

Operating systems for this use case could include members of the Linux
families (Fedora, Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, and similar).  When a platform
is compliant with the requirements of this use case, it should be
possible to install and maintain the Linux distributions, but modification
or specialization of the OS or firmware may be required.

It should also be possible to use any of the other Unix-based operating
systems and distributions such as those in the BSD family, as well as
commercial operating systems such as Microsoft Windows.  Again, some
modification or specialization may be required.

Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSs) will play a role here as well,
depending on how the platform is being used.  Whether or not there
is a standard amenable to all RTOSs is TBD.

The stress here is on the idea of _appliances_ -- devices meant to
meet a specific need, with flexible levels of functionality, but
running on a consistent and unchanging set of hardware.

NOTE: this is currently a placeholder.  Such systems exist, but the
level of standardization required is not as clear as in the case of
general purpose computing platforms.

Appliance Computing Current Revision: *0* [September 2020]

### Special Purpose Computing
This use case sets out the requirements for _special purpose computing_.
Platforms of this class typically have fixed hardware, software and firmware
over the life of the product.  The device should be updatable to
handle security issues or product flaws.  Examples might be simple
remote sensors, light bulbs, toasters, or other small household appliance
controls.

NOTE: this is currently a placeholder.  It is not clear there exists
a set of standards for such devices, or even that such a set should exist.
