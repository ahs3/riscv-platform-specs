WARNING: all material from this section on was part of the
initial notes made for this specification and may or may not
end up being included in the final document.  It is retained
in this file until it is no longer needed -- it has either
been incorporated or removed from the OSPS being developed.

## User-Level Platform

* User-mode environments must implement at least version 2.2 of the RISC-V User
  ISA specification, which can be found at
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/master/release/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf.  
* User-mode programs may not execute the `fence.i` instruction.
* User-mode environments may provide additional ISA extensions, but if those
  extensions add user-visible state they must be initially disabled.
* Within main-memory regions, aligned instruction fetch must be atomic, up to
  the smaller of ILEN and XLEN bits.  In particular, if an aligned 4-byte word
  is stored with the `sw` instruction, then any processor attempts to execute
  that word, the processor either fetches the newly stored word, or some previous
  value stored to that location.  (That is, the fetched instruction is not an
  unpredictable value, nor is it a hybrid of the bytes of the old and new
  values.)

## Supervisor-Level Platform

* Supervisor-mode environments must implement at least version 0.2.0 of the
  RISC-V SBI specification, which can be found at
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-sbi-doc/blob/v0.2.0/riscv-sbi.adoc
* Supervisor-mode environments must implement the Sv39 page-based
  virtual-memory scheme.   Systems that support Sv48 must support Sv39, systems
  that support Sv57 must support Sv48, and so forth.
* Unless otherwise specified by a given I/O device, I/O regions are at least
  point-to-point strongly ordered.  All devices attached to a given PCIe root
  complex are on the same ordered channel (numbered 2 or above), though
  different root complexes might not be on the same ordering channel.
* On RV64I-based Unix-class systems the negative virtual addresses are reserved
  for the kernel.
* External devices (DMA engines, the debug unit, non RISC-V cores, etc) that
  are visible to RISC-V harts must appear as coherent agents, just like any
  RISC-V hart would.  If additional ordering constraints are necessary for a
  device to function, those will be provide by a device-specific mechanism.

## Machine-Level Platform

## Profiles

### Portable UNIX Platform Profile

* Supervisor-mode environments must implement RV64GC.
