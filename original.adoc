## Original Content

The following sections are from the very first version of this
specification.  So much has changed, however, that this content
has for now been moved to this appendix so that it can be reused
in the new form of the specification, if possible, but will not
distract from the new material being added.

As content in this appendix is reviewed and considered, it will
be either moved to the proper section along with any new material,
or it will be removed as no longer needed.  The goal is to eventually
empty this appendix so that it can then be removed from the specification.
