## Description

This document is the TODO List for the RISC-V Operating System
Platform Specification (OSPS).  It only exists because if we don't
write things down, they usually get forgotten somewhere.

## How To Use The TODO List
There's no real fixed format.  To add an item, add it to the
end of the list, incrementing the item number.  Please add a
date for when the item was created, too.  When an item has been
completed, please move it to the DONE list, noting when it was
done and by whom, if possible.
