# RISC-V Operating System Platform Specification

The files in this project are used to create the RISC-V Operating System
Platform Specification.  This specification defines the set of firmware
and hardware required of a RISC-V platform so that it may install and run
various operating systems.

The content of the specification is created and controlled by the RISC-V
Platform Specification Task Group.  Information about the group can be
found at https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-unixplatformspec (membership in
RISC-V International is required to participate, but it is free for
individual community members).
